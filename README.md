Pingu Racing
Alan and Bjarne are the two fastest penguins in Antarctica. In order to decide which of the two is the fastest penguin, they arrange a race. Your program should simulate the course of the race and decide who has won.

The rules of the race
The integer variable ttt represents the time over the course of the race. The total duration of the race is tdurationt_{duration}t 
duration
​
  seconds, so the time ttt runs in the interval [0;tduration)[0; t_{duration})[0;t 
duration
​
 ). The program calculates the positions and speeds of the two penguins for every second of the race.

The integer positions of Alan and Bjarne are posApos_Apos 
A
​
  and posBpos_Bpos 
B
​
  respectively, and can have any initial values. The integer speeds of Alan and Bjarne are speAspe_Aspe 
A
​
  and speBspe_Bspe 
B
​
  respectively, and both are 0 at the start.

Every second in the first half of the race ([0;⌊tduration2⌋)[0; \lfloor \frac{t_{duration}}{2} \rfloor)[0;⌊ 
2
t 
duration
​
 
​
 ⌋)) the following rules apply to determine the speed of the penguins:

Alan suffers from Tetraphobia. So if its current position posApos_Apos 
A
​
  ends with the number 4, its speed speAspe_Aspe 
A
​
  is halved (if necessary it is rounded down) and increased by 1.
Otherwise Alan is not afraid and can increase his speed speAspe_Aspe 
A
​
  by 7.
Bjarne, on the other hand, suffers from Triskaidekaphobia. So if his current position posBpos_Bpos 
B
​
  is divisible by 13, he gets an adrenaline rush and doubles his speed speBspe_Bspe 
B
​
  and increases it by an additional 1.
Otherwise Bjarne doesn't panic and can increase his speed speBspe_Bspe 
B
​
  by 3.
In the second half of the race ([⌊tduration2⌋;tduration)[\lfloor \frac{t_{duration}}{2} \rfloor; t_{duration})[⌊ 
2
t 
duration
​
 
​
 ⌋;t 
duration
​
 )) the above rules no longer apply, but only the following:

Basically, speAspe_Aspe 
A
​
  is now increased by 1 per time step. Only at the times ⌊35⋅tduration⌋\lfloor \frac{3}{5} \cdot t_{duration} \rfloor⌊

​

duration
​
 )) Bjarne is unlucky and stumbles, so that his speed is halved every second and rounded down if necessary.
There is also a maximum speed spemax=128spe_{max} = 128spe 
max
​
 =128, which must never be exceeded at any time. The speeds can never be negative either. I.e. if the speed exceeds the spemaxspe_{max}spe 
max
​
  or falls below 0 according to the above rules, the speed is simply set to spemaxspe_{max}spe 
max
​
  or 0.

After the current speed has been determined for the time ttt the position of the penguin is simply increased by the speed.

In the end, the penguin with the highest position wins. A draw can of course also occur.

Program Statement
Your program should ask the starting positions of Alan and Bjarne, as well as the duration of the race, and simulate the race.

The command prompt via the console should look like this:

Alan starting position:
Bjarne starting position:
Race duration:
If the entered race duration is negative, the following error message should be issued repeatedly until a non-negative race duration is entered:

Please do not enter a negative number:
For every second of the simulation, the positions and speeds of Alan and Bjarne should be output as follows:

t = <time>
Alan position = <posA>; speed = <speA>
Bjarne position = <posB>; speed = <speB>
It stands <time> for ttt, <posA> for posApos_Apos 
A
​
 , <speA> for speAspe_Aspe 
A
​
 , and so forth.

In the end, the winning penguin should be handed out. So if Alan wins:

Alan wins!
If Bjarne wins:

Bjarne wins!
And if the race ends in a draw:

Draw!
